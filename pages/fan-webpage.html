  <p class = "body-text"> One thing I am passionate about is anime! I grew up watching a lot of animation/anime and now it has become an important part of my life. </p>
  <p class = "body-text"> The beautiful artwork seems to resonate with my inner self. Every anime I watch manages to captivate and connect me to its world and characters. </p>
